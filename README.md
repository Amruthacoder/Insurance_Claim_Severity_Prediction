## 📌 Overview

This project leverages historical insurance data to predict claim severity using machine learning models. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and model evaluation to derive insights that help insurers make data-driven decisions. A Streamlit-based web app is built for easy claim amount predictions.

## 🔍 Key Features

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing trends in claim severity.

✅ Hypothesis Testing – Understanding key factors affecting claim amounts.

✅ Machine Learning Models – Training & evaluating regression models.

✅ Best Model Selection – Linear Regression chosen for highest accuracy.

✅ Web App Deployment – Built with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
 
	•	Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting)
 
	•	Hypothesis Testing (T-test for statistical significance)
 
	•	Streamlit (Interactive web app for claim prediction)
